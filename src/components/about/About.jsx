              i! I'm Renke Brixel, a front-end developer with a focus on crafting seamless and responsive user
              interfaces using Tailwind CSS and React. After completing a Full-Stack Web & App Development Bootcamp at
              WBS Coding School, Iâ€™ve gained extensive experience in building user-centric applications that are both
              functional and visually appealing.

              My expertise lies in front-end development, particularly with technologies like React and Tailwind CSS,
              but I'm comfortable working across the stack when needed. I enjoy creating efficient, clean, and scalable
              code that brings designs to life.

              When I'm not coding, you can often find me staying active with hobbies like running and hiking. These
              activities help me maintain a clear mind and a fresh perspective, which I bring into my development work
              to tackle complex challenges.

              I'm always open to new opportunities where I can apply my skills and collaborate on innovative projects.
